# 🚗 Car Price Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts **used car prices** based on features such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow including **data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation**.

---

## 📌 Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing (missing values, outliers, duplicates)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
* Feature engineering (encoding categorical features, scaling numerical data)
* Model training using regression algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.)
* Model evaluation with metrics like **R², RMSE, MAE**
* Deployment-ready, modular code structure
